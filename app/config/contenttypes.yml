# EVENT
#
# Notes:
# Requirement: On occasion we will not know the exact dates of events, but we would like to announce them. 
# For the day / month fields, there should be a (not known) to allow the user control over this.
# => Did not follow the date style with different text fields; If date fields are not filled out make them unknown
# Documents folder: This is required, so that you can show the root folder where the event documentation is going to be 
# stored. This will be created in the DMS first, and the user can then select this folder. 
# The folder area will be shown on the single events page, and when files are uploaded into this area, 
# then the website will update automatically.
#
# Issues: 
# - Different setup for event start and end
# - Make a seperation on location field
# - Integration google drive folders
#
# ToDos:
# - Validate regex for date/ time
# - Integration google drive folders
# - Maybe adapt contact values 
#
# Questions:
# - Is it possible to put validation on the datetime field?
# - Is it possible to structure type select while querying the db? Example: put a dash between value entries?
# - Where do the entries for contact come from?

# JOB
#
# Notes: 
# Type Location will show the Locations content types, that have the ʺThis is a Europeana place of workʺ checked
# NOTE: All job posts will be appended with the following:
# How to apply? 
# Send us your CV (in English) with a covering letter outlining what interests you about this position to: jobs@europeana.eu 
# Should you have any additional questions or require more information before deciding to apply, please send us an email. 
# You should respond before (depublication date)
# More about us 
# For more information see: (Europeana Foundation about link)
# The depublication date will be the last day that you should respond by, so if the depublication date was set to ʺFebruary 10, 2014ʺ 
# - then the job ad would be removed from the list, and the job page will be depublished. Before this date, there should 
# be text saying ʺYou should respond by February 10, 2014ʺ on the job page.
# 
# Issues: 
# - How to make either salary field (eur/ gbp) required?
# - Show only locations wehre europeana_place is checked  
# - Attachments should probably come from google drive?
#
# ToDos:
# - Integrate google drive
# - Finalize select lists based upon answers
#
# Questions:
# - What exactly is the name of the contenttype? Career or Job? 
# - Is it possible to show only values in type select which match a certain criteria. 
#   Example: show only locations where in the contenttype location the checkbox europeana_place is checked
# - What exactly is the scale for?
# - Is it possible to make one at least one salary required. Example: one has to select fields and one of it at least must be required

# BLOG POST
#
# Notes: 
# If this is type authors is populated, then instead of showing [By Owner] eg, "By Dean Birkett" in the byline, it will show "By [Written by]"
# Type Attachments should link directly with our DMS. This should allow for multiple files to be added, and not just one file
# Type owner is not shown at all if the Written by section is populated; I think dependet choice list are not possible?
#
# Issues:
# - Modify type attachment to link directly to the dms
# - Related content_N should include all content types....
#
# ToDos:
# - Clarify integration with dms
# - Probably add ALL contenttypes to the relation section (see Questions)
# - Implent answers to questions if possible
#
# Questions:
# - Is there a limit the length of element teaser to "show that the intro is brief, short and sweet"
# - Is it possible to add a new button (control) to the editcontent dialogue to directly call the dms in a popup? 
# - Is it possible to use the type filelist for integration with dms? For mulitple upload.
# - Is it possible to show in one relation ALL other contentypes or is this a single relation each time? 
# - Is it possible to build up dependend choice lists? E.g. disable the field owner if field written by ist populated

# PAGE
#
# Notes:
# Type position: If 2 blocks of content share the same value (eg both set to be first), then the latest should take precedence
# Type checkbox: This checkbox should control whether the page is shown in the overview/list page, or is a page that is reachable 
# via a top level link. If this is not checked, then the page will still be published, still be searchable, but will only be reached 
# via a link that has been placed in some body text.
#
# Issues:
# - Not defined how to build up the selectfield for parent to build a structure; using suggestion from bob with taxonomies
# - Restrict the mulitiple: true select to MAX: 2
#
# ToDos:
# - Clarify behavior of type parent
# - Implement answers to questions if possible
#
# Questions:
# - How does the permalink looks like? Solution with routing or should it stay with page/title?
# - Where do the contact persons come from? From contenttype person?
# - Is it possible to define the max amount of choosen entries from the contenttype select, multiple: true? Example: max choose two entries
# - How will be the exact handling of type support_navigation?
# - Should related content be shown on the contenttype (shown in prototype demo.deanbirkett but not in excel docs.google.com)?

# STRUCTURE
#
# Notes: 
# Some of these list pages (eg - the publications list page), will not need creating here, 
# they should be dynamic lists that show anything that was created as a publication, likewise the staff list page 
# should show any person that has been created
#
# Comment Bob for parent issue:
# There's no real support for hierarchical content in Bolt, but you can use grouping to structure it somewhat better
# What we often do, is that we use the "behaves_like: grouping" taxonomy for this. We make one group called 'main' or 'top', 
# with a bunch of pages, and then as much groups as we have top level pages.
#
# Issues: 
# - Not defined how to build up the selectfield for parent to build a structure; using suggestion from bob with taxonomies
# - The slug contenttype does not fit the requirement
#
# ToDos:
# - Define the templates for visualization in type templateselect
# - Define top level pages in taxonomy.yml and delete selectfield for parent if taxonomy is choosen as the prefferd way
#
# Questions:
# - Is it possible to build up contenttype slug with a slash in it? Example: /parent/title
# - Can one use choosen taxonomies for the value of a slug type? Example: value: taxonomy['main']
# - How exactly will be the handling for taxonomy tags? Are there prefilled tags?

# Issues:
# - Not prooven that one can get marked entries from europeana_place in the job contenttype. See ToDos.
#
# ToDos: 
# - make content type not crawable
#
# Questions:
# - Is it possible  in the contenttypes to choose values in type: select based upon a certain value in another contenttype?
#   Example: Conenttype location with checkobox marked. Contenttype Job will only get location values which are marked.
